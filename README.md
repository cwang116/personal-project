<h5>Introduction</h5>
The personal project I decided to develop is a fully functional website build from WordPress. I choosed WordPress as a tool since many of teams use it to build website for their capstone projects. Throughout their demonstrations, I have learnt the advantages and features of WordPress. In addition, WordPress is one of the most popular open source blogging tool and content management system in the world as there are around one-fourth of websites are build from WordPress. 

During the development, I have learnt how to create a website from scratch on my own initiatives – all steps from getting hosting and domain name to installing WordPress and creating website.
